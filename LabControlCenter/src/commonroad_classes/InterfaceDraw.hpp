     * local_orientation was added as a parameter
     * \param ctx A DrawingContext, used to draw on
     * \param scale - optional: The factor by which to transform all number values related to position - this is not permanent, only for drawing (else, use InterfaceTransform's functions)
     * \param global_orientation - optional: Rotation that needs to be applied before drawing - set as global transformation to the whole coordinate system
     * \param global_translate_x - optional: Translation in x-direction that needs to be applied before drawing - set as global transformation to the whole coordinate system
     * \param global_translate_y - optional: Translation in y-direction that needs to be applied before drawing - set as global transformation to the whole coordinate system
